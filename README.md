<h1>Hi, I'm Shannon! 
<h2>🙋🏻‍♀️ About Me: </h2>

My dive into Cybersecurity began as a passion project. From a young age I gravitated towards computers as an outlet for entertainment and education, like the childhood of any Gen Z kid the prime of technology was just rolling out and I wanted to get my hands dirty with all of the latest developments. From troubleshooting with my family's old Macintosh, clocking in hours creating the most extravagant amusement park via Rollercoaster Tycoon on PC, and filing through pages of code to find the bug causing a delay on the music player on my Tumblr profile. Seamlessly nostalgia of my childhood is captured through time stamps of technological milestones. 
In addition to this comfort with technology, I grew an interest to the study of forensics during highschool. I loved taking apart criminology; the who, what, why, when. This bloomed into my education in Forensic Psychology. My itching obsession for why people committed the acts they did fuled a BA and MA degree from John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

During my time at the criminal justice college is when I was first exposed to cyber crimes: hacking and exploitation of sensitive data. As part of my majors course work, I had to depict why individuals engaged in all types of illegal and heinous acts, including those in the digital realm. I began the series Mr. Robot (I know) which introduced me to the idea that data is the most vulnerable currency, especially for conglomerate companies and governments. It aided my understanding that cybersecurity literacy is becoming as fundamental to one's safety as simply looking both ways before crossing the street. 

While I've pursued the Forensic Psychology/Mental Health field with full force, I plan to utilize my already seasoned skills in conjunction with some new technical one's to pave my way into cybersecurity. Having worked in various behavioral crisis settings I've developed familiarity with risk mitigation and complex problem solving, which are fundamental frameworks within cybersecurity. Moreover, being exposed to vulnerable populations of psychiatric patients, I've built a tool of empathy; an ability to put one's self into another's shoes. This is an underrated variable that I believe contributes to any overwhelming success of a cybersecurity professional. Empathy can be used in order to comprehend how data threats might be created, where vulnerabilities are coming from, and who may be responsible.

I've embarked on a fulfilling journey to transition cybersecurity from merely a passion to a career. My path was short of conventional yet, I wouldn't have started any other way! Enjoy roaming around my Github portfolio of projects created to showcase my exposure and skills. Thanks for stopping by!🫧💌
