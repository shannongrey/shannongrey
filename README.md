<h1>Hi, I'm Shannon! 
<h2>🙋🏻‍♀️ About Me: </h2>

My dive into cyber security began as a passion project. From a young age I gravitated towards computers as an outlet for entertainment and education. Comparable to the childhood of any Gen Z kid, the prime of technology was just rolling out and I wanted to get my hands dirty with all of the latest developments. It started as troubleshooting my family's old Macintosh to clocking in hours creating the most extravagant amusement park via Rollercoaster Tycoon on PC, or filtering through code to find the bug delaying the automated music on my Tumblr profile. Seamlessly nostalgia of my childhood is captured through time stamps of technological milestones. 
In addition to this comfort with technology, I grew an interest to the study of forensics during high school. I loved taking apart criminology; the who, what, why, when. This bloomed into my education in Forensic Psychology. My itching obsession for why people committed the acts they did fueled a Bachelors of Arts and Masters of Arts degree from John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

During my time at the criminal justice college is when I was first exposed to cyber crimes: hacking and exploitation of sensitive data. As part of my majors course work, I had to depict why individuals engaged in all types of illegal and heinous acts, including those in the digital realm. I began the series Mr. Robot (I know) which introduced me to the idea that data is the most vulnerable currency, especially for the conglomerate enteprises that have much of it to spare. It aided my understanding that (cyber) security literacy is as fundamental to one's safety as looking both ways before crossing the street. 

While I've pursued the Forensic Psychology/Mental Health field with full force, I plan to utilize my already seasoned skills in conjunction with some new technical one's to pave my way into cyber security. Having worked in various behavioral crisis settings I've developed familiarity with risk mitigation and complex problem solving, which are fundamental frameworks within cyber security. Moreover, being exposed to vulnerable populations of psychiatric patients, I've built a tool of empathy; an ability to put one's self into another's shoes.  Empathy is underrated in being implemented to comprehend how data threats might be created, where vulnerabilities are coming from, and who may be responsible. Moreover, initating an understanding for information systems has assuredly reinforced my inherent interest for evidence based approaches and analyzation of puzzles. 

I've embarked on a fulfilling journey to transition cyber security from merely a passion to a career. My path was short of conventional yet, I wouldn't have started any other way! This platform will recreationally exhibit my learning and projects along the way. Enjoy roaming around my Github portfolio and thanks for stopping by!🫧💌
